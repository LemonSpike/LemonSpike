### cout << "Hello world" << endl << "👋";

I'm Pranav, a software dev with 2 years of commercial experience.

My purpose is to create apps that people love to use. Not only do I want to create delightful apps, but I want to **solve real problems**.

I have been an iOS dev for a long time, and am now becoming a more generalist software engineer.

I graduated in 2020 from Imperial College London in [Computing](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/courses/pg/msc-computing/) and achieved a Distinction 😍. I developed the first-ever (completely native Swift) iOS Yoga 🧘🏾‍♂️ action recognition app for my Individual Thesis (code under NDA 📄 though). 

🥰 Awarded [Imperial Award Stream 1](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-development/imperial-award) for hosting 3 Raspberry Pi student workshops:

- 1️⃣ Raspberry Pi Workshop One Demo Code: https://github.com/LemonSpike/Web_Scraping

- ☘️ Raspberry Pi Workshop Three Demo Code: https://github.com/LemonSpike/Raspberry_Pi_Bootloader

I have contributed to Apple's 🛠swift-algorithms🛠 package already and gave a talk at ✨NSLondon✨:

I am still early in my career, but I love coding. I am currently working as an iOS Contractor 👷🏾 but in my spare time:

- 🌱 I'm currently learning Flutter 🐥 w/ Dart 🎯.
- 🤔 Looking for help with reading between the lines of Apple documentation 🤔.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have cooked Vegetarian Lasagna, Pepper Quesadilla, Bloomer Bread, and Paneer Tikka Pizza (with base) all from scratch 😋!
- 🥅 Trying to build more side projects.
