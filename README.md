### cout << "Hello world" << endl << "👋";

Hi! I am Pranav, a passionate software dev based in London, UK.

I enjoy coding in Swift and Objective-C and am now becoming a more generalist software engineer.

I recently graduated from Imperial College London in Computing and achieved a Distinction. This was one of my proudest achievements because I found the course extremely challenging. Alongside a Distinction grade in exams, I developed the first ever Yoga action recognition iOS app for my Individual Thesis with Swift (under NDA). I was awarded the [Imperial Award Stream 1](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-development/imperial-award) for outstanding extracurricular engagement for multiple Raspberry Pi Workshops, Entrepreneurial Work and Student Engagement.

I am still early in my career, but I love coding and enjoy building new things. I am currently working as an iOS Contractor but in my spare time:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Flutter w/ Dart.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with reading between the lines of Apple documentation 🤔.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy cooking across cuisines. I have cooked Lasagna, Quesadilla, Bread, Pizza (with base) in the past and all from scratch!
