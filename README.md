### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I am Pranav, a passionate software dev based in London, UK.

&nbsp;

I enjoy coding in Swift and Objective-C and am now becoming a more generalist software engineer.

I recently graduated from Imperial College London in Computing and achieved a Distinction. This was one of my proudest achievements because I found the course extremely challenging. I enjoyed the challenge though and it taught me the fundamentals of CS faster than I thought was humanly possible! XD

I am not really sure what I want to do in the future, but I love coding and enjoy learning something new. I am currently working as an iOS Contractor but in my spare time:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Flutter w/ Dart.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with reading between the lines of Apple documentation ðŸ¤”.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy cooking across cuisines. I have cooked Lasagna, Quesadilla, Bread, Pizza (with base) in the past and all from scratch!
